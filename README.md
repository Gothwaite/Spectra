# Spectra is a simple game where you shoot incoming ships with laser sto protect your city. The only controls are moving the mouse and clicking.
#
# You pick one upgrade at the end of each round, which is randomly selected from a CSV file. Each upgrade helps or hinders different stats, and finding out which does what through experimentation is the key to getting past the later waves. Or you can cheat and just check the CSV file.
